## 22:53

I finally set up a diary repo, yay!

Today was busy. We had prayer meeting in the afternoon, which we missed (of course), and then a meeting with Ms. Nancy. Traffic from BT to Panera Bread was horrible! And then we were with Ms. Nancy for 4 hours...

I'm happy to be home. I also get to watch Blacklist :)
