There's a lot I haven't written in my journal. Maybe it's because I just don't feel like writing or maybe it's because I don't know what to say. It's during moments like these that I start to write poetry or get stuck in a book for hours.

Everything gets so bleak. Even the things that should be fun seem so dull. People are graduating, including Mom, and I feel so... seperated from it all. Maybe I'm jealous. Or maybe I'm just hurt. Mom wants me to have a graduation party and I'm not sure how to tell her I don't want one. I'm not even sure if I _should_ tell her. Is it just pride that keeps me from wanting a party? Maybe.

I think I'm ashamed. I do have that right, but should that really be what I'm feeling? I should be happy I finally made it, right? I mean, I haven't actually finished yet, but shouldn't I be proud? Instead, I want to hide and just get it over with silently. Why have a party? What's to celebrate? I finally graduated high school in my early twenties, that's not an achievement.
